A Lightweight Visual Automation System
-----------------------------------------

### Overview

This Visual Automation System, a digital doppelg√§nger of human action, operates within the confines of Jupyter Lab. It creates and executes automated workflows based on the recognition of screen elements, much like an artificial eye scanning a landscape.

### Features

* Grab a portion of the screen like a snip tool
* Store the snips with logic in each automation workbook as base64 string
* Run workflow by running the workbook
* Supports point-and-click, wait-for-image, time-based, or event-based automation steps

### Design Philosophy

Pypersicope is designed to be an ultra-simple automation interface that can be used by humans from cell phones or other devices. The tool aims to provide a reliable and fault-tolerant workflow recording mechanism, allowing users to pick up where they left off in case of any errors or interruptions.

### Target Audience

The Scope class is designed for capturing and processing screenshots using Python's pyautogui and image manipulation libraries. It allows users to capture a portion of their screen, define specific areas of interest, and save or load these areas as base64-encoded images. Below is an overview of how to use the class.

### LLaMA Integration

Pypersicope is designed to work seamlessly with LLaMA 3 and other LLMs. Users can choose their preferred LLM and integrate it with Pypersicope to create a powerful automation workflow.

### Roadmap

* 1st release
* Image detection
* Ollama integeration for text descriptions
* Launch control and error handeling
