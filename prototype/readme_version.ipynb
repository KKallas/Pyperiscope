    "PyPeriscope bridges the gap between modern workflow automation and legacy applications through intelligent GUI automation. Built for businesses that need to automate desktop applications and document processing without relying on cloud services or complex integrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## System Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "PyPeriscope operates as a distributed system with three main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **API Queue Server**: Manages workflow distribution and state tracking\n",
    "   - Accepts automation requests from n8n\n",
    "   - Assigns unique identifiers for tracking\n",
    "   - Maintains workflow state and history\n",
    "   - Handles distribution across multiple automation servers\n",
    "   - Provides status polling endpoint for n8n\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Automation Servers**: Mac servers that execute GUI automation\n",
    "   - Run workflows from the queue\n",
    "   - Handle visual pattern matching and interactions\n",
    "   - Process documents and legacy applications\n",
    "   - Report status back to queue server\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **n8n Integration**: Orchestrates overall process flow\n",
    "   - Initiates automation requests\n",
    "   - Polls for completion status\n",
    "   - Handles successful completion\n",
    "   - Manages error resolution workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example: Submit workflow to queue\n",
    "response = await api.submit_workflow({\n",
    "    'workflow_type': 'document_processing',\n",
    "    'template': 'invoice_extract',\n",
    "    'input_data': {...}\n",
    "})\n",
    "workflow_id = response['workflow_id']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Poll for status\n",
    "status = await api.get_workflow_status(workflow_id)\n",
    "if status['needs_intervention']:\n",
    "    # Handle human intervention\n",
    "    await n8n.trigger_intervention_flow(workflow_id)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why PyPeriscope?\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern automation tools like n8n excel at API integrations, but many business applications either lack APIs or make them prohibitively complex. PyPeriscope solves this by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Automating any GUI application across multiple Mac servers\n",
    "- Enabling partial automation for human-in-the-loop workflows\n",
    "- Managing complex workflow queues with state tracking\n",
    "- Processing documents without reverse engineering file formats\n",
    "- Running entirely locally for maximum privacy and cost control\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Use Cases\n",

    "- Distribute work across multiple automation servers\n",
    "- Handle concurrent processing requests\n",
    "- Manage server availability and load\n",
    "- Track processing status and history\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error Recovery\n",
    "- Detect automation blockages\n",
    "- Queue tasks for human intervention\n",
    "- Resume workflows after resolution\n",
    "- Maintain audit trail of interventions\n",
    "\n",
    "### High-Volume Operations\n",
    "- Load balance across multiple servers\n",
    "- Handle peak processing periods\n",
    "- Maintain processing SLAs\n",
    "- Monitor system capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### Queue Management\n",
    "Distribute and track automation workflows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pyperiscope import QueueManager\n",
    "\n",
    "# Submit workflow to queue\n",
    "workflow_id = queue.submit_workflow(workflow_data)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check status\n",
    "status = queue.get_status(workflow_id)\n",
    "if status.needs_intervention:\n",
    "    queue.request_intervention(workflow_id)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual Automation\n",
    "Create reliable GUI automation workflows through pattern matching:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pyperiscope import Scraper\n",
    "scraper = Scraper(pyautogui.screenshot())\n",
    "step = scraper.get_scope()  # Visual selection creates automation step\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow Integration\n",
    "Combine n8n's API capabilities with PyPeriscope's GUI automation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# n8n workflow submits to PyPeriscope queue\n",
    "workflow_id = pyperiscope_api.submit_workflow(workflow_data)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Monitor status\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    status = pyperiscope_api.get_status(workflow_id)\n",
    "    if status.complete:\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    if status.needs_intervention:\n",
